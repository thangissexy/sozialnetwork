# sozialnetwork

Sozialnetwork is a web application. This is a simple social network with basic functions (writing, seeing and deleting posts, exploring and making new friends, checking others' profiles). 

The application uses Spring Boot framework and Heroku PostgreSQL database.

Feel free to experience the application on https://sozialnetwork.herokuapp.com/

Sign up, add new friends and write some posts today!

P/S: The application currently works problem-free unfortunately only on Mozilla Firefox due to session persistence problems on other web browsers and I am trying to solve it. If you have a solution to this problem please contribute, I am open to any recommendations to improve this application. I would appreciate that a lot! 

Thank you guys!
